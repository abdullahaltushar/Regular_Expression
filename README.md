<h3>Special Sequences</h3>
<p>
\A	Returns a match if the specified characters are at the beginning of the string	"\AThe"	
\b	Returns a match where the specified characters are at the beginning or at the end of a word
(the "r" in the beginning is making sure that the string is being treated as a "raw string")	r"\bain"
r"ain\b"	
\B	Returns a match where the specified characters are present, but NOT at the beginning (or at the end) of a word
(the "r" in the beginning is making sure that the string is being treated as a "raw string")	r"\Bain"
r"ain\B"	
\d	Returns a match where the string contains digits (numbers from 0-9)	"\d"	
\D	Returns a match where the string DOES NOT contain digits	"\D"	
\s	Returns a match where the string contains a white space character	"\s"	
\S	Returns a match where the string DOES NOT contain a white space character	"\S"	
\w	Returns a match where the string contains any word characters (characters from a to Z, digits from 0-9, and the underscore _ character)	"\w"	
\W	Returns a match where the string DOES NOT contain any word characters	"\W"	
\Z	Returns a match if the specified characters are at the end of the string	"Spain\Z"</p>
<h3>Sets</h3>
<p> [arn]	Returns a match where one of the specified characters (a, r, or n) is present	
[a-n]	Returns a match for any lower case character, alphabetically between a and n	
[^arn]	Returns a match for any character EXCEPT a, r, and n	
[0123]	Returns a match where any of the specified digits (0, 1, 2, or 3) are present	
[0-9]	Returns a match for any digit between 0 and 9	
[0-5][0-9]	Returns a match for any two-digit numbers from 00 and 59	
[a-zA-Z]	Returns a match for any character alphabetically between a and z, lower case OR upper case	
[+]	In sets, +, *, ., |, (), $,{} has no special meaning, so [+] means: return a match for any + character in the string</p>
